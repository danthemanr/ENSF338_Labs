1. First, I would check if my room number was in the range 100-130, then I would follow the apropriate sign. I assume that I cannot assume ascending room numbers. The algorithm that requires the least walking is a linear search starting at EY100 and checking both last digits until they are 28. If I can assume that the room numbers are assending upon seeing EY100 first: I would only have to check the middle digit until it's 2, then the last digit until it's 8. I would not consider using interval or interpolation search because that would take more walking.
2. First, I would need to check that the room I'm looking for is >=100 and <=30 (2 steps). For each room I check, I would go to that room (1 step) and check both last digits (2 steps). I have to do that for rooms 100, 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, 120, 122, 124, 126, and 128, which is 15 rooms in total. 2 + 15*(1+2) = 47 steps.
3. EY128 is neither the worst nor the best case for this floorplan and algorithm.
4. EY100 and EY138 are the best case scenarios, as they would both be the first room that you check. The worst case scenario would be a room number that isn't on the floor, then you would check the whole floor.
5. If I have memorized the layout of the floor, then I would just go straight to EY128. However, if I was giving directions to someone, I would tell them to start looking for it on the right side.
